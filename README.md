# 🧰 Simple Bash Scripts

This repository is a personal collection of simple Bash scripts created by **Shady Emad**.

Each script is standalone and kept in the root directory for simplicity.  
All scripts are written for learning, automation, and Linux practice purposes.

📄 Every script includes its own `README.md` file that explains its purpose and usage.

Feel free to explore, run, and modify any of them as you like.
